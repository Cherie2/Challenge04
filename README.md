# Javascript-POP-Quiz

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to create a website that allows users to take a Javascript quiz. The quiz application will allow the user the opportunity of taking a timed quiz on the basics of javascript. The user wil be able to submit their intials at the end of the quiz and receive their score. The simple yet responsive design of the website is stream-lined for use on various screen sizes.

In completing this project I have learned the fundamentals of Javascript; including the use of variables, functions, for loops, event listeners, local storage, data attributes, timers, and creating/appending elements.
